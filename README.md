# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Tweeter is a full stack web application project built with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills. It is a TWITTER 'knock-off' that can draw from a small database use AJAX. It can also simulate the basic fuctions of posting a tweet and throwing simple error messages. It also has an embedded feature to help prevent 'Cross-site Scripting' vulnerabilities. 

It is the second project to help me learn about the workflow of building good habits using timely github commits and learning how to slowly code and test. Another important skill was how to debug code and this goes back to incremental coding and commits instead of trying to test for too many parameters. It is the first time using async features in a project.

I still have plenty to learn, not just about coding but to also refine my workflow and the 'HAPPY PATH'. Due to time constraints I was unable to implement more advanced features as I was busy fixing bugs to ensure functionality. The pace of the bootcamp requires me to CATCH UP and stay on top of my work.
